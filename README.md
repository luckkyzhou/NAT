# NAT
---
## Functionality
1. Yes, the code work correctly
- The INPUT is NAT.txt and FLOW.txt.
- The OUTPUT is below.
![](/output.png "output")
2. Yes, the program will throw error if txt files can't be opened.
- But the program could be optimized by adding error throw at checking whether input flows are valid.

---
## Code clarity and cleanliness
1. The code is well structured. But I don't use object-oriented principles.
- I will optimize the program later with object-oriented principles at how to encapsulate the whole program.
2. The logic is not well encapsulated.
- Same as above, I will encapsulate the whole program later.
3. Yes, it is easy to understand the code. The names of variables and functions are descripted with comments. And the code is simple, avoiding overly complex.
